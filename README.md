 # Credit Risk Analysis

 ## Overview of the Analysis

 During this analysis we are going to check the Card Risk using the CSV file provided using machine learning algorithms. Such as,

    - Naive Random Oversampling
    - SMOTE oversampling
    - Cluster Centroid Undersampling
    - Easy Ensemble Classifying

Between others, this way we can train our models and get results that are going to help us during the analysis. 


## Results

First we have the Oversampling analysis having an Accuracy of 57.77% and then showed the other data at the classification report.

Then we can see the SMOTE analysis
